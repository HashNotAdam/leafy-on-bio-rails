# README

This is a very quick and dirty rebuild of [Leafy on Rails](https://github.com/hstonehouse/leafy-on-rails) to create discussion with [Helen Stonehouse](https://github.com/hstonehouse)

## Getting started

First, create your database with seed data: `bin/rails db:setup`.

Then you can boot the Rails server like normal. Just remember to either use the dev script (`bin/dev`) or manually boot a Tailwind watcher (see `Profile.dev`).
